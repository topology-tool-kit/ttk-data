This directory contains two Python scripts, [run.py](./run.py) and
[validate.py](./validate.py), used for validating all ttk-data state
files with new TTK releases.

The first script, [run.py](./run.py), generates PNG screenshots for
every state files. Just call `python3 run.py` or `python3
tests/run.py` to generate a PNG per view of every state file. These
PNGs will be stored by default under `tests/output_screenshots`. To
generate screenshots for only one state file, use `python3
tests/run.py -i states/file` (from the root `ttk-data` directory,
which contains the pipeline inputs).

The second script, [validation.py](validation.py), compares generated
screenshots from `tests/output_screenshots` to a refererence stored in
`tests/reference_screenshots`. By default, it will also run the
[run.py](./run.py) script to generate the current screenshots to be
compared. Use `python3 validate.py -c` to skip the screenshots
generation and only compare previoulsy generated screenshots.

To generate a new reference, use `python3 validate.py -r`. Please note
that the reference is dependent on the following factors:
* to be independent of the display resolution, an offscreen ParaView
  renderer (OSMesa on Linux) is recommended.
* the C++ random generator used in the TTKIdentifierRandomizer filter
  to color segmentations in several states is dependent on the
  compiler version. The current reference has been generated with
  GCC11 (not compatible with neither Clang nor GCC≤10).
* the TTKDimensionReduction filter ouput depends on the version of the
  Scikit-learn Python package. Please use a recent Scikit-learn (use
  pip on Ubuntu, the system package on ArchLinux).
* The HarmonicSkeleton state file depends on the
  `Eigen::ConjugateGradient` iterative solver, which is
  non-deterministic. The image comparison threshold has been increased
  for this state file accordingly.

As a consequence, to reproduce the current reference, the following is required:
* a Linux OS
* an OSMesa installation of ParaView (configured with
  `-DPARAVIEW_USE_QT=OFF -DVTK_USE_X=OFF -DVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA=ON`)
* a GCC11-built TTK
* a pip-installed Scikit-Learn
* see [the automatic test yml script](https://github.com/topology-tool-kit/ttk/blob/dev/.github/workflows/test.yml) for installation examples.
